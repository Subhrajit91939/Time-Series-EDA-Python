**Day-1: Exploratory Data Analysis and Stock Analysis with Time Series Data**

1. **Pandas datareader - For Financial Data**
2. **Date Time Index**
3. **Time Resampling \

        **Basic Idea of Time Series Data:**

* **Upward Trends**
    * **Mean will increase for an upward trend.**
* **Stationary trend:**
    * **Mean remains near constant, later on we will convert upward and downward trends to Stationary Trend, which will simplify the forecasting process.**
* **Downward trend**
    * **Mean will decrease for a downward trend.**
* **Cyclic Data:**
    * **Stock data are an example of cyclic data.**
